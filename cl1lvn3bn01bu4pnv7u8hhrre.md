# I Recently Completed freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Projects.


## How long did it take me to get through the course?
 

- I first went through the course in 2021, until I got to the projects section. I had to pause since all my focus was then on preparing for my final year exams.

- Come January 2022, I went back to the course but realised I probably wouldn't remember enough of the concepts covered to be able to tackle the projects. So, I decided to start all over again.

- When I finally got to the projects section in February 2022, I thought I would be beneficial to my learning process if I typed out the sample projects and see the effects each CSS instruction had on the code. It was great for me to learn that way and I enjoyed the process.

- I completed the last project at the end of March. I was not working on the course daily, and I also had long periods where life just got in the way. So this is by no means an indication of how long it would take to get through the course.


## About the projects

There were 5 projects to complete. The level of complexity increased as I progressed through the projects. The projects were as follows:

### Tribute Page

**About This Project**

This was a very basic project which tests the student's ability to present information on a page. I completed it in 1 day.

**Concepts Tested**
         
- use of *h1* element

- adding an image to a page

- adding a link to a page

**Challenges Encountered**

- This was a simple project to complete. I did not encounter any challenges.


### Survey Form

**About This Project**

This was another basic project which tests the student's ability to set up a form. I completed it in 1-2 days.

**Concepts Tested**

- implementing the HTML *form* element

- specifying the requirements for the different fields used in a form

- use of paragraph element

**Challenges Encountered**

This was a straightforward project to complete. I did not encounter any challenges.


### Product Landing Page


**About This Project**

Things started heating up with this project. Arranging elements on the page became more complex. It too me longer to complete the project than the first two. I did not use any libraries, so the little knowledge I had gained so far about HTML and CSS was put to the ultimate test. On several occasions, I walked away from my desk feeling some level of frustration because items were behaving strangely when I resized the page. 

I designed the page using [figma](https://www.figma.com) and then went on to code it. It was quite exciting to see the process through from design to implementation, particularly because I am new to [figma](https://www.figma.com).

I referred to documentation more frequently during this project, and completed it in 3 days.

**Concepts Tested**

- setting up a header that contains a logo and navigation

- using flex box

- navigating to different parts of a page

- use of the *form* element

- embedding video on a page

- making the page responsive

**Challenges Encountered**

- I initially struggled to get the logo and navigation links to align properly, especially when resizing the page.

- My landing page is about course registration. I used a grid to display cards for each course offered. Everything looked okay until it was time to make the page responsive. I just couldn't get the cards and their contents to behave - especially the CTA buttons.

- I experienced the same challenge when it came to the *form* element used to display an email field and submit button. I felt like there was a fundamental principle I was missing, and I had no idea what it was. I will have to revisit the project when I've gained more knowledge and make the necessary corrections.

### Technical Documentation Page

**About This Project**

I got to use the grid-template-areas for the first time with this project, to organise the different parts on the page. Again I referred to documentation and also watched [Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xMQfnTU6oo)'s video about CSS grid.

The CSS grid and flex box are two topics I definitely need to study and practice some more. The course did a great job of introducing the concepts and testing my understanding on the projects. The rest is up to me to dig further.

I completed the project in 2 days.

**Concepts Tested**

- implementing different page sections for a technical documentation

- making the page responsive


**Challenges Encountered**

- When resizing the screen, a portion of the text on the main section of the grid seemed to disappear behind the nav section.

- The grid resized as expected after implementing a media query, but the text still had some issues.

### Personal Portfolio Webpage

**About This Project**

I was very happy with how the project turned out. It was my first attempt working with [figma](https://www.figma.com) and my first portfolio site. Nothing fancy; just a basic site showcasing the projects done as part of the course. It was exciting to code the design into an actual page.

I completed the project over a space of 4 days.

**Concepts Tested**

- setting up different sections of a webpage

- arranging projects as tiles on the page and linking to external sources

- making the page responsive

**Challenges Encountered**

I had no challenges; it just took longer to complete the project.

## Which project was the most challenging?

The responsive aspect of the landing page. I struggled to control the buttons within the grid.

## What's next?

I will be proceeding to the Javascript course and see how that goes. I also plan to revisit the concepts I had issues with in the projects.

## Have you taken this course?

- how was your experience?

- what did you do next after the course?

- what resources would you recommend as a next step for a deeper understanding of HTML and CSS?
